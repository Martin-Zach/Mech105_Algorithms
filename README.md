# Mech105_Algorithms #
This repository contains various MATLAB codes created during my freshman Mech105 class in 2022 that perfrom the following functions:
* False Position
* Linear Regression
* LU Factorization
* Simpson's 1/3 rule
* Special Matrix

These functions should work for any type of input that follows the guidlines stated in the indiviual README files inside each folder.
These codes are not perfect and rather show my progression as a MATLAGB coder.
